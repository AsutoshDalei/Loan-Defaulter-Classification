## Introduction
In consumer finance, lending money is a delicate balance between opportunity and risk. Loan providing companies often face challenges in lending to individuals with insufficient or non-existent credit history, thus facing the challenge of identifying potential customers who can responsibly manage their loans. This project aims to tackle that challenge by analysing historical data to identify patterns that can help predict which applicants are likely to default on their loans.

The lack of credit history information can lead to adverse outcomes, where some consumers exploit the situation and become defaulters. In this context, our project addresses two critical risks associated with loan approval decisions:
* Opportunity Loss: Failing to approve loans for applicants who are capable of repaying them results in missed business opportunities.
* Financial Loss: Approving loans for applicants likely to default can lead to significant financial losses for the company.
